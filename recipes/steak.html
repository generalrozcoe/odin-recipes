    <p>Simple steak, simple to make</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Steak</li>
        <li>Seasoning blend</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>1/4 Onion chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>Stainless Steel Pan</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre- heat your stainless pan. The way to check it's ready is throw some droplets of water on the pan and see that they skip around.</li>
        <li>Lightly coat the pan in oil, preferably non seed oil.</li>
        <li>Cook down the onions with an ocassional toss. </li>
        <li>I like my steak on the rarer side so I do 2 minutes per side. If you like to ruin your food, you can let it cook more thoroughly.</li>
        
        <li>The most important step is once you take the steak out, let it rest. It will soak up the precious juices that it let out in the cooking process.</li>
    </ol>
